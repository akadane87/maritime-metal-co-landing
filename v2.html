scrap metal from the manufacture through the recycling process so it may be used again

for industry. <br>

as the services we provide. By conducting business with integrity, responsibility and

concern for the environment, we provide maximum value to our customers. <br>

materials ranging from low-grade iron to vacuum quality alloys. Our scrap metal material

is sold to regional, national and international consumers and mills.

closing. These containerâ€™s close and lock to eliminate any chance of thievery from your

scrap metal material. By providing this type of equipment we will decrease your down

time for handling your scrap, increase your productivity too add to your bottom line. <br>
There is no challenge more motivating to our professional team than to scope out a

complex situation and then respond with customized recycling programs. In meeting

the specific requests of our industrial partners , we have expanded into new regions, and

reached new heights in state-of- the-art processing.

Maritime Metal Company will pick up filled containers of scrap and replace them with

empties on an on-call or regular scheduled program basis. We will provide as many

containers as required at any time to meet your material handling needs. All containers

are provided at no charge for use inside and outside of the plant.

Our prices are aggressive and remain that way regardless of the market conditions that

would tend to discourage the smaller feeder yards. Since we deal only with the end-user,

our prices stay at the top end, and we are proud to share this advantage to all of our

customers. Our payment terms are customized per your request and can be paid by check

or ACH. <br>
